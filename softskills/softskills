1. The more people there are in a call, the shorter your sentences should be, and the less time that should be taken up in communicating.

  when working technical problems and troubleshooting, we often ask, 'what's changed?'. This works, too, with people and escalations.
  Why do they suddenly care?
  What changed in their own situation? Do they have a deadline looming?

# MEETINGS
  "Find ways to share your problems that others can relate to (and learn from)"
  "You aren't just speaking. you're sharing. teaching. reporting. Each is a different role, and"
  "requires a different set of skills"

#TAM Skills
Drill down on everything. always ask why. why why why...do it recursively
When you have your answer, ask "why" the answer...do that three times and you'll come to some 
core skill that is deeply beneficial to understand...or some unknowable truth about the universe that can teach you humility in what we do not know!

Confidence is absolutely crucial. the knowledge that you can be thrown into any situation and be just fine comes from technical skills. The more you know, the easier it'll be for you to show up and show people you know it

No need to ask for permission or form a quorum on every decision. Confidently state your plan, clearly and plainly. State it in a way that is assertive, but leaves openings for others to add or disagree.

Welcome dissent, but do not invite it. It takes up too much of the call to stop and ask every time. If others on the call are active listeners, they'll speak up

"Evaluate the dynamics of a situation, and then take a definitive, preemptive step -- take charge"
-Commander William T. Riker, Starship Enterprise

Use short sentences. Long, rambling explanations are often the result of lack of confidence

temporary fixes are always more permanent than you think.
